# What is Git?
- ### Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track, manage, and control changes to your project's files over time.
- ### The power of Git lies in its ability to save each change (commit) you make to your project's files by keeping a history of changes, allowing you to revert to any previous version if needed.
- ### It enables multiple people to collaborate on a project.

# Commands
- ### Most Git commands starts with git keyword to tell the system that you are using Git.

- ## git init
  - Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one.
  - Now that we have created a repository, we are in need to start adding and tracking project files. Let's move on to the second command, which is git add.

- ## git add file-name, * or .
  - Add file contents to the index
  - Once you have created a Git repository, your project files will be untracked by the Git. To let Git start tracking project files, use the git add command to let it track files.
  - Using * or . instead of file-name will let all project files be tracked.
  - Then the project files either tracked or untracked so we are in need for command to check the status of project files. Lets move on to the next command, which is git status.

- ## git status
  - Show the working tree status this means showing the status of untracked files if it is modified or unmodified (at staging area to be commited).
  - Once I have done all the changes, I will need to save or make a checkpoint for changes that have already been made, so we will jamb to the next command, which is git commit.

- ## git commit -m "leave a message describes what you did in this commit"
  - A commit in Git records the latest changes to the repository, saving them in the projectâ€™s history.
  - Each commit represents a version of your project, saved in the history of changes, allowing you to revert to it if needed.


- ## git branch
  - List, create, or delete branches
  - git branch
    - List all branches.
  - git branch branch-name
